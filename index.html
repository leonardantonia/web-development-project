            <p>
                Hello! Welcome to my website, my name is Antonia or you can call me Nia. 
                I first got interested in technology in high school when I took an AP computer science course and coded in 
                python, I then decided that's what I would major in. But after my first semester here at KSU I realized I did 
                not like coding much in Java and I did't realize how challenging it would be, so my second semester I changed 
                my major to IT because I still wanted to be in the field of technology. I also became interested in UX/UI design 
                from a friend and after taking a few courses, I believed that I wanted to break into Data Science and/or cybersecurity.
                <br><br>

                My first year at KSU, I wasn't involved much and spent a lot of time in my room or studying
                it felt like I didn't spend much time to make friends or to enjoy the college experience. Noticing this, I decided to 
                apply to be an Residential Assistant to push myself out of my comfort zone. This year I got the position and I love it. 
                Being a RA is more than a title, it has allowed me to socialize more freely and meet so many people. It has placed me 
                in a leadership role and allowed me to build skills that I may need for my future career. I can now say I am starting 
                to enjoy college and my RA peers have given me a family and strong support system.
                <br><br>

                Another awesome opportunity that college has given me is to work at the Recreation Center. I 
                started off as a service desk attendant, sitting at the front desk, greeting people, making sure they have a membership, etc.,
                and after about 7 months, I applied for the Facility Operations Assistant position and I am now in a leadership role
                here at the rec center. I work on Tuesdays and Thursdays, where I open the facility in the morning and get it ready for 
                everyone to come in and recreate. Placing myself in these positions has truly helped me build character, responsibility, and 
                strong communication. KSU has a great atmosphere for all students to learn and enjoy!
